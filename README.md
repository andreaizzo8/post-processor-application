# post-processor-application

I made this project for the final exam of High School. I worked on a team to develop a PostProcessor Application used to communicate to Numerical Control Machines (such as drills, lathes, mills and others). This application consists mostly in a compiler, that is essentially a translator between one programming language and another language.

We had to follow all the phases of Project Management (planning and execution) and create a Lexer (lexycal analysis) and a Parser (sintactical analysis). We used Java, a build automation tool (Maven) and we had to study and apply the Generative Grammar Theory (by Noam Chomsky).

The team was composed by Vittorio Cortosi, Gianni Yenque and Andrea Izzo (me).
